# Algorithm-Visualizations
### Background 
- Poisson-Disc Sampling vs. Random Sampling
  - Poisson-Disc: Candidates are chosen from a sampling area. The best candidate is the one that is farthest away from all previous samples. After candidates are created and distances measured, the best candidate becomes the new sample. Remaining candidates are discarded.
  - Uniform Random Sampling: results in severe under and oversampling where many samples are densely overpacked or overlapping.
- Fisherâ€“Yates Shuffle and Quicksort
  - The Fisher-Yates Shuffle algorithm runs in linear time and uses constant space. It splits an array into two parts, the right (shuffled) and left (unshuffled) sides. Step by step, the algorithm randomly picks an element from the left and moves it to the right.
  - Quicksort: partitions an array into two parts by picking a pivot. The left of the pivot has elements less than the pivot while the right has elements greater than the pivot. It then recursively sorts the left and right parts. When a section has only one element left, recursion stops.
